HOW TO RUN
----------
To run the code on Euler remove all previously loaded nodules (purge) and load the following modules:

env2lmod
module load gcc
module load openmpi

You can request 8 cores and an interative shell to work with:
bsub -n 8 -W  04:00 -Is bash

Then compile and run by typing
make run


WHAT TO MODIFY
--------------
You only need to change the code in wave.cpp
When the code runs, it prints a checksum. This number should be the same for the solution you provide.


CODE OUTPUT 
-----------
the code will output simple .txt files with the solution, saved as
x y z u
...
